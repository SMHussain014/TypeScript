//  1.  What is TypeScript?
// First of all, Typescript is not a new language.
/* Although the browsers support Typescript, but it, at its own, cannot run on a browser, therefore, it is converted
into Javascript for its execution. Speaking technically, it is transpiled into JavaScript*/
// That is why it is said that Typescript is the superset of Javascript
// However, it provides Object Oriented Programming
// Typescript was introduced by Microsoft on 1st October, 2010.
// 2.   Why use Typescript?
// It has IDE support like VSC, Sublime, Atom etc.
// It supports ECMA script, meaning thereby new features are introduced in it first. In other word, it defines standards
// It controls as well as uses only data types, classes, inferences etc.
// It has easy code management
// 3.   What are the pre-requirements?
// A simple code editor, i.e. VSC, Sublime, Atom, Note++ etc.
// Node.js, typescript; and
// A basic idea of Javascript
// 4.   How to install Typescript?
// At first, we have to install 'Node.js', to check type 'node -v'
// Thereafter install Typescript by using 'npm install -g typescript' and to check type 'npm or tsc -v'
// 5.   How to run?
// Make a file with any suitable name and its extension will be '.ts'
// After writing the code, save the file and convert it into a JavaScript file by using 'tsc file_name.ts'
// Now, run JavaScript file by using 'node file_name.js'
// 6.   How to make 'config' file?
// Every typescript file must have a config file to control data flow
// To do so, type 'tsc --init' in terminal in cmd or powershell mode
// At S.No. 29 and 58 of that config file, we may specify source and public folders and many more settings.
